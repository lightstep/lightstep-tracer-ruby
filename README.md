The LightStep distributed tracing library for Ruby.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'lightstep'


And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install lightstep


## Getting started

    require 'lightstep'

    # Initialize the OpenTracing global tracer
    OpenTracing.global_tracer = LightStep::Tracer.new(
      component_name: 'lightstep/ruby/example',
      access_token: 'your_access_token'
    )

    # Create a basic span and attach a log to the span
    span = OpenTracing.start_span('my_span')
    span.log(event: 'hello world', count: 42)

    # Create a child span (and add some artificial delays to illustrate the timing)
    sleep(0.1)
    child = OpenTracing.start_span('my_child', child_of: span)
    sleep(0.2)
    child.finish
    sleep(0.1)
    span.finish

## Thread Safety

The LightStep Tracer is threadsafe. For increased performance, you can add the
`concurrent-ruby-ext` gem to your Gemfile. This will enable C extensions for
concurrent operations.

The LightStep Tracer is also Fork-safe. When forking, the child process will
not inherit the unflushed spans of the parent, so they will only be flushed
once.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `make test` to run the tests.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
